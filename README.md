some tools to tweek lightroom pictures and catalog

These scripts are provided as is with no warranty and may need manual updates to work on your local environment.

Having migrated my lightroom library from windows to mac and currently hosting the pictures on a NAS lead to various errors.

To briefly describe my current setup, my lightroom catalog is stored on a single host.
Pictures are hosted on a NAS, mounted with samba/afp to my laptop.
It used to be stored on 3 external hard drives and have been migrated to the NAS using rsync.

Many folder have french style accents in it, may be listed but content unavailable through the network mount.

The first script aims at renaming all library folders to normalize folder names.

More scripts may be added in the future.
